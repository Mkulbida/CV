\subsection{Michael Kulbida}\label{title}}

My passion lies in providing effective interventions to child and family
programs utilizing data based management, analytics, and visualization.
I have lead the creation of multiple public programs involving the child
welfare population and promotion of high-quality early chlidhood
education.

I am currently searching for a position within the public sphere that
will allow me to utilize my knowledge of early childhood and leverage my
data analysis and program evaluation skills.
